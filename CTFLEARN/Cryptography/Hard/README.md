# Cryptography(Hard)

## So_many_64s

* Website: https://ctflearn.com/challenge/121

* Solution: ```b64 decode```

    * Keep decoding the text
 
* Code: ```python So_many_64s/So_many_64s.py```

* Flag: ```ABCTF{pr3tty_b4s1c_r1ght?}```

## Encryption_Master 

* Website: https://ctflearn.com/challenge/243

* Solution: A lot of methods of encryption/decryption 

    * Use ```b64decode()```, ```bytes.fromhex()```, ```chr()```

* Code: ```python Encryption_Master/Encryption_Master.py```

* Flag: ```CTF{I_AM_PROUD_OF_YOU}```

## Symbolic_Decimals

* Website: https://ctflearn.com/challenge/231

* Solution: **Keyboard Mapping**

    * We could see the keyboard, and mapping ```!@#$%^&*()``` to ```1234567890```

    * Then, we could map the number to the corresponding character

* Code: ```python Symbolic_Decimals/Symbolic_Decimals.py```

* Flag: ```CTF{Star_._Wars_._For_._Life}```

## RSA_Twins

* Website: https://ctflearn.com/challenge/484

* Solution: **RSA**

    * Don't think too much, we could first try to factorize the ```n```

* Code: ```python RSA_Twins/RSA_Twins.py```

* Flag: ```flag{i_l0v3_tw1N_pr1m3s}```
